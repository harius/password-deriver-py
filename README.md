**password-deriver** is a tool to derive passwords from a master password in a deterministic way. It is indended for my personal use, so breaking changes are possible and even likely.

The key derivation method is the same one that's used in the [**lesspass**](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass).
The password formatting is also currently **lesspass**-compatible, but that's a subject to change.
